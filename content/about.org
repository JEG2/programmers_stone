* About the Author

My name is James Edward Gray II â€” JEG2 around some parts of the Internet. I have been a developer for around two decades.  These days I manage developers.  In both roles, teaching programming has always been a big focus of my work.

When programming, I'm passionate about design.  When managing, I try to empower teams of self-organizing Musketeers.  When teaching, I care deeply about practical examples, visualization of algorithms, and how to train fluency.

I co-wrote [[https://pragprog.com/titles/jgotp/designing-elixir-systems-with-otp/][Designing Elixir Systems with OTP]] with Bruce Tate, who's one heck of a nice guy.  I'm developing a strong appreciation for [[https://livebook.dev/][Livebook]] and I have always loved regular expressions and board games.
